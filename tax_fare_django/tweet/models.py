# self.user.username
# Shows the username of the user who posted the tweet.
# Makes it immediately clear who posted the tweet.


# self.text[:10] (but remember, your field is actually test, not text)
# Shows the first 10 characters of the tweet.
# This gives you a quick preview of the tweet without dumping the whole text (which might be long).
